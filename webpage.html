                with loyalty care,and friendship. Now there is the dog <br>
                called the German shepherd and to me it is the most <br>
                reliable of all the dogs. They have a history that is <br>
                different from others, they can be trained to always <br>
                stand by you, they are strictly bred to perfection, and <br>

                Australian Shepherd, the cowboy's herding dog of <br>
                choice, is a medium-sized worker with a keen,penetrating<br>
                gaze in the eye. Aussie coats offer different looks,<br>
                including merle (a mottled pattern with contrasting<br>
                shades of blue or red).In all ways, they're the picture<br>
                of rugged and agile movers of stock. Aussies exhibit an<br>
                irresistible impulse to herd, anything: birds, dogs, kids. <br>
                This strong work drive can make Aussies too much dog can <br>
                make Aussies too much dog for a sedentary pet owner.<br>
                Aussies are remarkably intelligent, quite capable of <br>
                hoodwinking an unsuspecting novice owner. In short,<br>

                An Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a rugged, imposing flock<br>
                guardian of ancient lineage.Protective and territorial, <br>
                but also intelligent, patient, and profoundly loyal,<br>
                these muscular avengers are prized as working guard dogs<br>
                without equal. Profusely muscled but nimble afoot, <br>
                Anatolians are more than a match for the predators <br>
                and harsh terrain of their homeland.Anatolians descend <br>
                from some of the oldest known domestic-canine bloodlines. <br>
                This lends the breed a sense of timelessness, a no-<br>
                frills, untouched quality that takes us back 6,000 years <br>
                to the Bronze Age. Anatolians are smart, devoted, responsive,<br>
                and adaptable. They will protect their flock's livestock,<br>
                children, smaller dogs, even the family cat's with intensity.<br>
                Anatolian owners must be strong leaders, willing and able to <br>
                handle a dog as dominating and demanding as he is calm and loving.<br>

                The Belgian Shepherd (also known as the Belgian <br>
                Sheepdog or the Chien de Berger Belge) is<br>
                a breed of medium-sized herding dog from Belgium. <br>
                While predominantly considered a single breed,<br>
                it is bred in four distinct varieties based on <br>
                coat type and colour; the long-haired black<br>
                Groenendael, the rough-haired fawn Laekenois, <br>
                the short-haired fawn Malinois, and the long-<br>
                haired fawn Tervuren; in the United States <br>
                the American Kennel Club considers the four <br>
                varieties to be separate breeds.The breed <br>
                descends from a common type of shepherd dog <br>
                found throughout Western Europe that<br>
                includes such modern breeds as the Bouvier <br>
                des Ardennes, Dutch Shepherd and German Shepherd.<br>
                A common sight in the service of Belgian shepherds<br>
                for centuries, it was not until the end of<br>
                the 19th century that a breed club was formed <br>
                and attempts were made to standardise the breed.<br>

                The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great<br>
                beauty, stands among America's most popular dog breeds. They <br>
                are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for <br>
                the blind,and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other <br>
                competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when <br>
                not at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog <br>
                of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold <br>
                that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its<br>
                friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle,<br>
                is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, <br>
                powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed <br>
                fanciers say, with a 'merry action'. Goldens are outgoing, <br>
                trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively<br>
                easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to <br>
                life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. <br>
                These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For <br>
                a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, <br>
                swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.<br>

                The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's <br>
                most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly, outgoing, and <br>
                high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection <br>
                to go around for a family looking for a medium-to-large dog. <br>
                The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending <br>
                on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder <br>
                and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes <br>
                in yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, <br>
                the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, tapering <br>
                'otter tail' seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate<br>
                eagerness.Labrador are famously friendly. They are companionable <br>
                housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize <br>
                well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't mistake <br>
                his easygoing personality for low energy: The Labrador is an <br>
                enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like <br>
                swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and <br>
                mentally fit.

                Kind but courageous, friendly but dignified, the Bulldog <br>
                is a thick-set, low-slung, well-muscled bruiser whose <br>
                'sourmug' face is the universal symbol of courage and <br>
                tenacity.These docile, loyal companions adapt well to <br>
                town or country. You can't mistake a Bulldog for any <br>
                other breed. The loose skin of the head, furrowed brow, <br>
                pushed-in nose, small ears,undershot jaw with hanging <br>
                chops on either side, and the distinctive rolling gait <br>
                all practically scream. The coat, seen in a variety of <br>
                colors and patterns, is short, smooth,and glossy. Bulldogs <br>
                can weigh up to 50 pounds, but that won't stop them from <br>
                curling up in your lap, or at least trying to. But don't <br>
                mistake their easygoing ways for laziness Bulldogs enjoy <br>
                brisk walks and need regular moderate exercise, along with <br>
                a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons are best <br>
                spent in an air-conditioned room as a Bulldog's short <br>
                snout can cause labored breathing in hot and humid weather.

                Although it hardly seems possible when you look at <br>
                a primped-up Poodle in the show ring, the breed was <br>
                originally a water retriever, a job that requires jumping <br>
                in the water to fetch waterfowl for hunters.

            <p>
                The Rottweiler is a robust working breed of great strength <br>
                descended from the mastiffs of the Roman legions. A gentle <br>
                playmate and protector within the family circle, the Rottie <br>
                observes the outside world with a self-assured aloofness. <br>
                A male Rottweiler will stand anywhere from 24 to 27 muscular <br>
                inches at the shoulder; females run a bit smaller and lighter.<br>
                The glistening, short black coat with smart rust markings <br>
                add to the picture of imposing strength. A thickly muscled <br>
                hindquarters powers the Rottie's effortless trotting gait. <br>
                A well-bred and properly raised Rottie will be calm and <br>
                confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive. The aloof <br>
                demeanor these world-class guardians present to outsiders <br>
                belies the playfulness, and downright silliness, that endear <br>
                Rotties to their loved ones. Early training and socialization <br>
                will harness a Rottie's territorial instincts in a positive way.

                That face! Those big dark eyes looking up at you with that sweet <br>
                expression! It's no surprise that Shih Tzu owners have been so <br>
                delighted with this little 'Lion Dog's for a thousand years. <br>
                Where Shih Tzu go, giggles and mischief follow. Shi Tsu<br>
                weighing between 9 to 16 pounds, and standing between 8 and 11 <br>
                inches, are surprisingly solid for dogs their size. The coat, <br>
                which comes in many colors, is worth the time you will put <br>
                into it'¿few dogs are as beautiful as a well-groomed Shih Tzu. <br>
                Being cute is a way of life for this lively charmer. The Shih <br>
                Tzu is known to be especially affectionate with children.<br>
                As a small dog bred to spend most of their day inside royal <br>
                palaces, they make a great pet if you live in an apartment or <br>
                lack a big backyard. Some dogs live to dig holes and chase cats, <br>
                but a Shih Tzu's idea of fun is sitting in your lap acting <br>
                adorable as you try to watch TV.

                Yorkshire Terriers are affectionate towards their <br>
                people as one would expect from a companion dog,<br>
                but true to their terrier heritage, they're sometimes <br>
                suspicious of strangers, and will bark at<br>
                strange sounds and intruders. In consideration of <br>
                your neighbors,it's important to tone down their <br>
                happiness and teach them when and when not to bark.<br>
                Small in size but big in personality, the Yorkshire <br>
                Terrier makes a feisty but loving companion. The most <br>
                popular toy dog breed in the United States, the “Yorkie” <br>
                has won many fans with their devotion to their owners, <br>
                their elegant looks, and their suitability to apartment <br>
                living.
